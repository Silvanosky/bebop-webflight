# bebop-webflight

Pilot the Bebop 2 directly from your browser. Extend the application with plugins
to add features such as video recording, autonomous flight, face recognition, and more.
It makes it a very friendly environment to quickly build and experiment with your drone
(Fork of [ardrone-webflight](https://github.com/eschnou/ardrone-webflight)).

**This branch is the development branch, there are no packaged release yet.**

## Built-in plugins

* **[video-png](plugins/video-png/)** stream the video to the browser through static image loading,
    works great in every browser. Requires ffmpeg installed on your system.

* **[hud](plugins/hud/)** to visualize a head-up display with artificial horizon, compass,
    altimeter, etc. Based on [nodecopter-cockpit](https://github.com/bkw/nodecopter-cockpit)

* **[pilot](plugins/pilot)** to control the drone remotely using the keyboard. Based on [drone-browser](https://github.com/functino/drone-browser).

* **[battery](plugins/battery)** display a battery widget in the top bar.

* **[blackbox](plugins/blackbox)** records all mission data (raw video, navdata, etc.) on the disk.

* **[replay](plugins/replay)** replays a mission by injecting the data at the client level. Makes it a very
friendly tool to code/test/debug when you can't fly. **You need to use video-png for video, not compatible with video-stream yet.**

## Install

WebFlight requires a recent nodejs (built and tested with node > 0.10) as well as
[npm](https://npmjs.org/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) for dependency management.

In order to use the video-png plugin, you also need ffmpeg installed on your system.

```
git clone https://github.com/Silvanosky/bebop-webflight.git
cd bebop-webflight
npm install
bower install
```

## Usage

1. Copy the config.js.sample to config.js and edit to select your plugins
2. Connect to the drone's wifi
3. Run `node app.js`
4. Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/


### Controlling the drone

Actually I use an xbox one controller, I will implemented the keyboard soon.

!!Not implemented yet!!
If you have enabled the **pilot** plugin, you can fly the drone with the following keys. You can define your keyboard in the 
config file. In the plugin, `azerty` and `qwerty` keyboards are defined.  Feel free to define others.

Use `z, s, q, d` to move front, back and sideways. Use your `cursors` to go up/down or turn
clockwise/counter clockwise. Use `t` to takeoff and `l` for landing.

Use the `tab` key to toggle acceleration speed slow/fast.

Use the `f` key to perform a flip in the current direction of movement.

Use the `c` key to switch the video feed between front/bottom camera.

Use the `e` key to recover from an emergency after a crash.

### Record a mission

Just press the `r` to start recording. A popup alers you when the recording starts. Press `r` again to stop. Each mission
is bundled in its own folder.

## Adding your own plugin

There is no tutorial yet, in the meanwhile, just have a look at the built in plugins,
it is faily straightforward.
